# Description: When listing or extracting from an archive a given subset
# of members, only the first matching argument was counted.  This led
# to spurious "Not found in archive" errors.  For example, tar 1.35
# when used in the test below, outputs
#
#  tar: dir/a1: Not found in archive
#  tar: dir/b1: Not found in archive
