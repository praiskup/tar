AT_SETUP([--no-overwrite-dir])
AT_KEYWORDS([extract extrac23 no-overwrite-dir])

# Description: Implementation of the --no-overwrite-dir option was flawed in
# tar versions up to 1.32.90.  This option is intended to preserve metadata
# of existing directories.  In fact it worked only for non-empty directories.
# Moreover, the first fix caused some permissions (depending on the current
# umask) and modification times to get overwritten when the directory had not
# the S_IWUSR bit set in its actual permissions, and also caused failure
# to extract an empty directory if the already existing directory had not
# the S_IWUSR bit set in its actual permissions and changing the permissions
# was not possible.
