%%name: tar

%%short-description: Creates tar archives

%%full-description:
GNU tar is an archiver that creates and handles file archives in various
formats. You can use tar to create file archives, to extract files from
previously created archives, store additional files, or update or list
files which were already stored.

The program saves many files together into a single tape or disk
archive, and can restore individual files from the archive. It
includes multivolume support, the ability to archive sparse files,
automatic archive compression/decompression, remote archives and
special features that allow 'tar' to be used for incremental and full
backups.

The supported archive formats are: V7 tar, GNU, ustar and POSIX (also
known as pax interchange format). GNU tar is also able to read and
extract 'star' archives.

Tar can direct its output to available devices, files, or other
programs (using pipes); tar can even access remote devices or files
(as archives).
